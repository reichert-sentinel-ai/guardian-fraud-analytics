# Criminal Intelligence Database Portfolio Optimizer - Business Impact Summary

**One-Page Executive Brief**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

**Medicare Advantage plans face catastrophic financial losses from Star Rating drops:**

| Company | Event | Financial Impact | Year |
|---------|-------|------------------|------|
| **Humana** | 4.5 → 3.5 star drop | **$150-200M loss** | 2024 |
| **Centene** | <3.0 star plans | **Contract termination risk** (100K individuals) | 2024 |
| **UnitedHealth** | 4.0 → 3.5 star drop | **$500M-$1B** at risk | Potential |

**Root Cause:** Reactive gap closure strategies fail to prevent rating drops. Plans need **6+ months advance warning** to intervene effectively.
